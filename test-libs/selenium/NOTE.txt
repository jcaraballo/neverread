Removed the following libraries that didn't seem necessary (at least for the moment):

apache-mime4j-0.6.jar
bsh-1.3.0.jar
cglib-nodep-2.1_3.jar
commons-jxpath-1.3.jar
jcommander-1.13.jar
jna-3.3.0.jar
operadriver-v0.7.3.jar
protobuf-java-2.4.1.jar
serializer-2.7.1.jar
testng-6.0.1-nobsh-noguice.jar
xml-apis-1.3.04.jar

Also removed junit-dep-4.8.1.jar from here because I'm already using junit 4.8.2 in the project

The following have been kept despite not being needed because they _are_ needed if WebDriver
configuration is changed to use FirefoxDriver instead of HtmlUnitDriver
guava-r09.jar
json-20080701.jar
